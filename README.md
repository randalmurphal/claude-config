# Symphony - Advanced Orchestration System for Claude Code

A sophisticated orchestration system that implements skeleton-first development with merge-purge-continue patterns, architectural deviation tracking, and intelligent parallel execution.

## 🎯 Overview

Symphony transforms Claude Code into a powerful development conductor, managing complex multi-file projects through:
- **Merge-Purge-Continue Pattern**: No interruptions, progressive refinement
- **Deviation Tracking**: Handles architectural discoveries without stopping work
- **Smart Parallel Execution**: Workers in isolated "chambers" with git worktrees
- **Living Mission Context**: Requirements evolve as understanding improves

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. **Skeleton-First Architecture with Deviation Handling**
- Builds complete structure before implementation
- Workers mark deviations when skeleton doesn't match reality
- Three implementation cycles: Implement → Merge/Purge → Refine
- Preserves good code even when architecture changes
- No work interruption - complete then resolve

### 2. **Intelligent Context Management**
- Context importance scoring: MUST READ / SHOULD KNOW / REFERENCE
- Living mission context that evolves with discoveries
- Business logic extraction before architecture
- Progressive context refinement between phases
- Each phase outputs what the next needs

### 3. **Smart Validation & Recovery**
- Phase-specific recovery agents for targeted fixes
- Intelligent failure classification (design_flaw, typo, etc.)
- Auto-detects project validation tools (Python/JS/Go)
- Test impact analysis for selective test execution
- Complexity metrics using language-specific tools (radon/gocyclo/eslint)

## 🎭 The Symphony Pattern

### Main Command: `/conduct`

The Symphony orchestration follows a **7-phase workflow** with merge-purge-continue cycles:

```
1. Business Logic Extraction → Extract rules before architecture
2. Architecture & Validation → 95% confidence required
3. Implementation Skeleton → Create structure with interfaces
4. Test Skeleton → Define test structure (no implementation)
5. Implementation (3 Cycles):
   Cycle 1: Initial Implementation (2 hours)
   - Workers implement in chambers
   - Mark deviations when skeleton doesn't match
   - Document architectural discoveries
   
   Cycle 2: Merge, Purge & Resolution (1 hour)
   - Orchestrator reviews deviations
   - Makes architectural decisions
   - Merge agent applies decisions
   - Preserves good code, purges incompatible
   
   Cycle 3: Refinement (1 hour)
   - Redistribute clean code
   - Continue from consistent state
   
6. Test Implementation → Write tests against real code
7. Validation → Comprehensive checks
8. Documentation → Update project docs
```

### Key Principles

- **No Interruptions**: Workers complete tasks despite discoveries
- **Deviation Tracking**: Mark architectural mismatches, continue working
- **Merge-Purge-Continue**: Progressive refinement without restarts
- **Living Mission**: Requirements evolve as understanding improves
- **Context Importance**: MUST READ / SHOULD KNOW / REFERENCE levels
- **Git Safety**: Merge to working branch only, never auto-push
- **Preserve Good Code**: Keep working patterns even when architecture changes
- **Clear Decisions**: Orchestrator makes calls, agents execute

## 🔄 Deviation Handling

When workers discover architectural mismatches:

### Severity Levels

**🟢 Minor**: Implementation detail differs
- Action: Implement better way, mark deviation
- Example: Sync in skeleton, async is better

**🟡 Major**: Architectural pattern change
- Action: Create stub, document, continue elsewhere
- Example: REST expected but GraphQL needed

**🔴 Fundamental**: Entire approach invalid
- Action: Interface stubs only, extensive docs
- Example: Auth system completely different

### Recording Deviations

```bash
python .symphony/tools/orchestration.py record-deviation \
  --agent "auth-impl" --module "auth" \
  --severity major \
  --expected "REST API" \
  --discovered "GraphQL required"
```

## 🧠 Intelligent Systems

### 1. **Module Cache & Gotchas** (`MODULE_CACHE.json` & `GOTCHAS.md`)
```json
{
  "confirmed_patterns": {
    "validation": {"pattern": "Always use Zod", "confidence": 0.95}
  },
  "anti_patterns": {
    "never_use": ["console.log in production", "var declarations"]
  }
}
```

### 2. **Pre-flight Validation** (User-specific caching)
- Checks environment readiness before starting
- Caches results in `~/.claude/preflight/{project_hash}.json`
- Avoids git conflicts with user-specific storage
- Offers recovery options if environment isn't ready

### 3. **Semantic Skeleton Diff**
- Only modifies files that need changes
- Preserves working code during refinements
- 10x faster than full rebuilds
- Maintains compilation validity

## 📊 Quality Standards

```yaml
test_philosophy:
  primary_validation: Integration test passes = code is validated
  secondary_metrics: Unit tests provide coverage numbers

test_coverage:
  lines: 95%          # Must achieve
  functions: 100%     # Every function tested
  branches: 90%       # Most conditionals covered

test_structure:
  mandatory_directories:
    unit_tests: tests/unit_tests/  # ALL unit tests here (NO EXCEPTIONS)
    integration_tests: tests/integration_tests/  # ALL integration tests here (NO EXCEPTIONS)
    violations: NO tests allowed outside these directories
  
  naming_requirements:
    unit_tests: test_[exact_source_filename].py  # EXACT 1:1 name match
    integration_tests: test_{workflow}_integration.py  # Workflow-level, not component
  
  separation_rules:
    mixed_files: FORBIDDEN - No file can contain both unit and integration tests
    directory_mixing: FORBIDDEN - Tests only in designated directories
    subdirectories: FORBIDDEN - No nested folders in test directories
  
  integration_test: 
    count: ONE comprehensive test class (1-2 files max)
    role: PRIMARY VALIDATION - passes = code validated
    scenarios: DATA configurations, not separate functions
    execution: Run process MINIMUM times, test MAXIMUM scenarios
    connections: REAL Server/DB/API (NO MOCKS)
    sequential_runs: Only for UPDATE/RE-CREATION/STATE TRANSITIONS/INCOMPATIBLE FLAGS
  
  unit_tests: 
    count: EXACTLY ONE file per source file (strict 1:1 mapping)
    role: SECONDARY - coverage metrics only
    coverage: 100% function coverage required
    mocking: Mock ALL dependencies
  
  e2e_tests: OPTIONAL - only if UI/API exists
```

## 🔧 Advanced Features

### Model Strategy (Optimized for Speed)
- **Haiku 4**: DEFAULT for skeletons, validation checks, test execution (3-5x faster)
- **Sonnet 4**: Complex implementation, escalation from Haiku
- **Default Model**: Reviews, security audits, complex reasoning
- **Smart Escalation**: Haiku → Sonnet → Default based on complexity

### Parallel Execution
The conductor identifies parallelizable work and launches multiple agents simultaneously:
- Implementation agents work on different modules
- Test writers create tests in parallel
- All coordinated through the conductor

### Progressive Validation & Recovery
**Two-Phase Validation**:
1. **Quick Phase (Haiku)**: Syntax, imports, tests, linting
2. **Deep Phase (Default)**: Security, architecture, performance

**Smart Recovery**:
- Distinguish ARCHITECTURE_FLAW vs MODEL_LIMITATION
- Route to appropriate fix (Phase 1 vs model escalation)
- Fast feedback loop with Haiku validation
- Maximum 3 recovery attempts before user escalation

## ⚡ Performance Improvements (v2.0)

### Speed Optimizations
- **30-40% faster** overall task completion
- **Haiku-First Strategy**: Default to Haiku for skeletons (3-5x faster)
- **Progressive Validation**: Catch 80% of issues in 20% of time
- **Smart Model Selection**: Right model for right task
- **Parallel Execution**: Multiple validation checks simultaneously

### Key Improvements
- **Issue Categorization**: ARCHITECTURE_FLAW vs MODEL_LIMITATION vs QUALITY_ISSUE
- **Model Escalation**: Haiku → Sonnet → Opus only when needed
- **Two-Phase Validation**: Quick checks (Haiku) then deep analysis (Default)
- **Strict Test Structure**: Enforced directories and 1:1 mapping
- **Integration-First Testing**: Integration = validation, Unit = metrics

## 🎯 When to Use This System

**Perfect for:**
- Projects touching 3+ files
- Tasks requiring comprehensive testing
- Features needing parallel development
- Complex refactoring with dependencies

**Not needed for:**
- Simple bug fixes
- Single file changes
- Documentation updates
- Minor configuration changes

## 🔮 System Evolution

This orchestration system learns and improves:
- Each task updates pattern confidence
- Failed approaches are remembered
- Successful patterns are reinforced
- Project-specific knowledge accumulates

## 🎵 Musical Theme & Personality System

### Vibe Modes
Claude adapts its personality while maintaining brutal honesty:

- **🎸 Solo** (default): Quick, direct, slightly sarcastic. "That's overengineered. Just use grep."
- **🎭 Concert**: Professional precision for production. "Critical: This exposes user data."
- **🎼 Duo**: Collaborative exploration. "Building on your idea, what if..."
- **📚 Mentor**: Socratic teaching method. "What do you think happens when...?"


### Auto-Formatting
Automatic code formatting after edits:
- Python: ruff → black fallback
- JavaScript/TypeScript: prettier → eslint
- Go: goimports → gofmt
- Configs in `~/.claude/configs/`

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Trust the Gates**: Let validation gates catch issues early
2. **Embrace Learning**: The system improves with use
3. **Delegate Everything**: The conductor never implements directly
4. **Maintain Skeletons**: Treat skeleton contracts as sacred
5. **Review Gotchas**: Periodically update `GOTCHAS.md` with new rules
6. **Pick Your Vibe**: Use `/vibe mentor` for learning, `/vibe concert` for production

## 🚧 Troubleshooting

**Environment Issues**: Run `/conduct` and choose option B to fix in new session
**Rule Conflicts**: Check `GOTCHAS.md` and update outdated rules
**Validation Failures**: Review gate feedback, often just needs refinement
