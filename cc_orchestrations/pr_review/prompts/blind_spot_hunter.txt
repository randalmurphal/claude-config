# Blind Spot Hunter Prompt

Investigate areas that first-round reviewers MISSED.

## Context

First-round reviewers looked at files based on their domain expertise.
You're looking for what they DIDN'T examine.

## Gaps Identified

These areas were not covered by any first-round reviewer:
{gaps}

## Changed Files

{diff_files}

## Your Task

1. For each gap, examine the relevant code
2. Look for issues the domain-specific reviewers wouldn't catch
3. Focus on cross-cutting concerns:
   - Error handling consistency
   - Resource cleanup (file handles, connections)
   - State management across calls
   - Backwards compatibility
   - Edge cases at boundaries

## Output Format

Return JSON:
```json
{
  "issues": [
    {
      "severity": "critical|high|medium|low",
      "issue": "Brief description",
      "file": "path/to/file.py",
      "line": 123,
      "details": "Full explanation",
      "recommendation": "How to fix",
      "gap_addressed": "Which gap this finding addresses"
    }
  ],
  "gaps_examined": ["gap1", "gap2"],
  "no_issues_areas": ["gap3 - examined, looks fine because..."]
}
```

## Focus Areas

- **Integration points**: Where modules connect
- **Data transformations**: Where types change
- **Boundary conditions**: Limits, empty cases, nulls
- **Concurrency**: Parallel access, race conditions
- **Cleanup paths**: Finally blocks, context managers, destructors

## NOT Looking For

- Style/formatting (ruff handles this)
- Type hints on existing code
- "Could be better" suggestions
- Theoretical issues without proof
