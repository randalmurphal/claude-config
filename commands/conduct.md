# /conduct - Full Orchestration

## 🎯 YOU ARE THE ORCHESTRATOR

**When to use /conduct:**
- Complex multi-component features
- Multiple interconnected modules
- Dependency management required
- Architecture planning needed
- Component validation at each step

**Prerequisites:** `.spec/SPEC.md` MUST exist (created by `/spec`)

**If no SPEC.md:**
Tell user: "No spec found. Run /spec first to create .spec/SPEC.md, then run /conduct."
STOP - do not proceed.

---

## Your Mission

1. Parse SPEC.md and build dependency graph
2. Analyze change impact (existing codebases)
3. Generate per-component phase specs
4. Execute each component: Skeleton → Task-by-Task Implementation → Full Validation
5. Enhance future phase specs with discoveries
6. Merge .spec learnings into permanent documentation
7. [Optional] Testing if user requested
8. Cleanup .spec/ directory
9. Deliver working, validated, documented system

**You are autonomous.** Don't ask permission between phases.

---

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Load Agent Prompting Skill

**CRITICAL: Load before spawning any sub-agents.**

```
Skill: agent-prompting
```

**This skill contains:**
- Critical inline standards for each agent type
- What to include in prompts (logging, try/except, mocking, etc.)
- Prompt templates with examples

**You will use this throughout all phases to write effective agent prompts.**

---

### Phase 2: Determine Working Directory

**Infer from task description which directory/component is being worked on:**
- Search for relevant files/directories mentioned in task
- Check project structure (e.g., monorepo with services/api/, services/auth/)
- If task mentions specific component/service → that's the working dir

**If unclear after search, ask:**
"Which directory should I work in? (provide path relative to repo root, or '.' for current)"

**Once determined:**
- `$WORK_DIR` = that directory
- Create `.spec/` at `$WORK_DIR/.spec/`
- All paths relative to `$WORK_DIR`

---

### Phase 3: Change Impact Analysis

**For existing codebases (not new projects):**

**Goal:** Understand blast radius of changes before starting work.

1. **Identify files to be modified** (from task description or SPEC.md if exists)

2. **For each file to modify:**
   ```bash
   # Find direct dependents (files that import this file)
   grep -r "from.*$(basename $file .py)" $WORK_DIR --include="*.py" -l
   grep -r "import.*$(basename $file .py)" $WORK_DIR --include="*.py" -l
   ```

3. **Recursively find transitive dependents** (dependents of dependents up to 2-3 levels)

4. **Generate impact report** and add to DISCOVERIES.md:
   ```markdown
   ## Change Impact Analysis

   Files to modify: X files
   Direct dependents: Y files (components: auth, api, frontend)
   Transitive dependents: Z files

   Critical dependencies:
   - auth/service.py imported by 8 files → breaking changes affect entire auth flow
   - api/endpoints.py imported by 23 files → API contract changes very risky

   Recommendations:
   - Maintain backward compatibility for auth/service.py
   - Consider deprecation path for api/endpoints.py changes
   - Plan coordinated rollout for components: [list]

   Test surface:
   - Must test: [critical dependent components]
   - Should test: [moderate dependent components]
   - Nice to test: [transitive dependents]
   ```

5. **Add to SPEC.md "Known Gotchas" section** if high-risk changes identified

---

#### GATE 3: Impact Analysis Voting

**Trigger:** IF transitive_dependents > 10

**Goal:** Multi-agent consensus on risk mitigation strategy for high-impact changes.

**Process:**

1. **Spawn 3 general-investigator agents in PARALLEL (single message with 3 Task calls):**

   ```
   Task(general-investigator, """
   Analyze risk and mitigation strategy for high-impact changes.

   Working directory: $WORK_DIR
   Impact Analysis: $WORK_DIR/.spec/DISCOVERIES.md (Change Impact Analysis section)

   Files to modify: {list}
   Transitive dependents: {count} files
   Critical dependencies: {list from impact report}

   Evaluate risk level and vote on best mitigation strategy:

   STRATEGIES:
   A. BACKWARD_COMPATIBLE: Maintain full backward compatibility, deprecation path
   B. COORDINATED_ROLLOUT: Breaking changes with coordinated deployment plan
   C. INCREMENTAL_MIGRATION: Phase migration over multiple releases
   D. REDESIGN_NEEDED: Impact too high, needs architectural redesign

   Return JSON:
   {
     "voter_id": "investigator-1",
     "risk_level": "HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW",
     "strategy_vote": "A|B|C|D",
     "reasoning": "Why this strategy is best",
     "specific_concerns": ["concern1", "concern2"],
     "mitigation_steps": ["step1", "step2"]
   }
   """)

   # Spawn investigators 2 and 3 with same prompt but different voter_id
   ```

2. **Collect votes and determine consensus:**

   ```
   votes = [vote1, vote2, vote3]

   # Count strategy votes
   strategy_counts = count_votes(votes, 'strategy_vote')

   IF any strategy has >= 2 votes (2/3 consensus):
     winning_strategy = strategy_with_most_votes

     Update DISCOVERIES.md:
     ```markdown
     ## Impact Analysis Voting Results

     Transitive dependents: {count} (threshold exceeded)

     Votes:
     - Strategy A (BACKWARD_COMPATIBLE): {count} votes
     - Strategy B (COORDINATED_ROLLOUT): {count} votes
     - Strategy C (INCREMENTAL_MIGRATION): {count} votes
     - Strategy D (REDESIGN_NEEDED): {count} votes

     **CONSENSUS: {winning_strategy}** (2/3 threshold met)

     Rationale:
     {combined reasoning from winning voters}

     Mitigation Steps:
     {consolidated mitigation steps from all voters}

     Risk Level: {most common risk_level from votes}
     ```

     Proceed with winning_strategy approach

   ELSE (no 2/3 consensus):
     ESCALATE to user:
     ```
     🚨 DECISION NEEDED: Impact Analysis Voting - No Consensus

     Transitive Dependents: {count} files (high-impact change)

     Votes:
     - Investigator 1: Strategy {X} - {reasoning}
     - Investigator 2: Strategy {Y} - {reasoning}
     - Investigator 3: Strategy {Z} - {reasoning}

     No strategy achieved 2/3 consensus.

     Please choose:
     A. BACKWARD_COMPATIBLE: {brief description from votes}
     B. COORDINATED_ROLLOUT: {brief description from votes}
     C. INCREMENTAL_MIGRATION: {brief description from votes}
     D. REDESIGN_NEEDED: {brief description from votes}

     Your choice: [wait for user input]
     ```

     Document user decision in DISCOVERIES.md
   ```

3. **Update SPEC.md with strategy:**
   - Add winning strategy to "Implementation Approach" section
   - Add mitigation steps to "Known Gotchas" section

**Skip this gate if:**
- New project (no existing code)
- transitive_dependents <= 10 (low impact)
- User explicitly says skip voting

**Commit changes**

---

**Skip this phase if:**
- New project (no existing code)
- Only creating new files (no modifications to existing files)
- User explicitly says skip impact analysis

**Commit changes**

---

### Phase 4: Parse SPEC.md & Build Dependency Graph

**Read SPEC.md:**
- Extract components from "Files to Create/Modify" section
- Extract dependencies from "Depends on:" field for each file
- Extract implementation phases (if specified)
- Extract quality requirements

**Build dependency graph:**
```
For each file in "Files to Create/Modify":
  file_path = extract path
  depends_on = extract "Depends on:" field
  complexity = extract "Complexity:" field
  purpose = extract "Purpose:" field

  graph[file_path] = {
    'dependencies': depends_on,
    'complexity': complexity,
    'purpose': purpose
  }
```

**Topologically sort components:**
- Perform topological sort on dependency graph
- Detect circular dependencies (DFS cycle detection)
- If cycle found → FAIL LOUD with cycle path
- Result: component_order (list of components in dependency order)

**Verify dependencies match reality (AUTOMATED VALIDATION):**
```bash
# For each component in dependency graph
for component in component_order:
  declared_deps = graph[component]['dependencies']

  # Use Grep to find actual imports in component file
  actual_imports=$(grep -E "^(from|import)" $component | \
                  sed 's/from \([^ ]*\).*/\1/' | \
                  sed 's/import \([^ ]*\).*/\1/' | \
                  sort -u)

  # Cross-reference with declared dependencies
  missing_deps = []
  for actual_dep in actual_imports:
    if actual_dep in project_modules AND actual_dep not in declared_deps:
      missing_deps.append(actual_dep)

  # FAIL LOUD if mismatch
  if len(missing_deps) > 0:
    ESCALATE: "Component {component} declares {declared_deps} but actually imports {missing_deps}. Fix SPEC.md dependencies before proceeding."
```

**Initialize tracking:**
- Create PROGRESS.md (see `~/.claude/templates/operational.md`)
- Create DISCOVERIES.md (merge with impact analysis from Phase 3)
- TodoWrite: Component-level tracking

**Commit changes** (with pre-commit validation):
```bash
# Git pre-commit hook will run automatically:
# - Auto-format (ruff/prettier/gofmt)
# - Linting (ruff check/eslint/golangci-lint)
# - Type checking (pyright/tsc)
~/.claude/hooks/pre-commit-validation.sh

# If hooks fail:
#   - Review output
#   - Fix issues
#   - Re-stage files: git add .
#   - Commit again
```

---

### Phase 5: Validate Component Phase Specs Exist

**Check for component phase specs:**
```bash
# Look for SPEC_N_*.md files in .spec/
ls $WORK_DIR/.spec/SPEC_*.md | grep -v "^SPEC.md$"
```

**If component phase specs exist (created by /spec):**
- ✅ Use them as-is
- Verify they match component_order from dependency graph
- Skip to Phase 6

**If component phase specs DON'T exist (fallback):**
- Generate them now from SPEC.md

**Generate fallback specs for each component in component_order:**

Create `.spec/SPEC_{phase_num}_{component_name}.md`:

```markdown
# Phase {N}: {Component Name}

## Components in This Phase
- {file_path}
  - Purpose: {from SPEC.md}
  - Complexity: {from SPEC.md}

## Dependencies
{List what this component depends on from previous phases}

## What's Available from Previous Phases
{Initially empty, will be populated as phases complete}

## Success Criteria
{Extract from SPEC.md for this component}

## Known Gotchas
{Extract from SPEC.md "Known Gotchas" section}
{Will be enhanced as phases complete}

## Implementation Phases
{Extract from SPEC.md "Implementation Phases" section}

Tasks per phase:
- {task 1}
- {task 2}

## Testing Requirements
{Extract from SPEC.md "Testing Strategy"}
```

**Result:**
```
.spec/
├── SPEC.md                        # High-level architecture (unchanged)
├── SPEC_1_foundation.md          # Phase 1 component details
├── SPEC_2_database.md            # Phase 2 component details
├── SPEC_3_api.md                 # Phase 3 component details
├── ...
├── DISCOVERIES.md                # Learnings captured here
└── PROGRESS.md                   # Phase tracking
```

**Note:** Ideally /spec creates these during discovery. This is fallback if missing.

**Commit changes**

### Phase 6-N: Component Phases (for each component in dependency order)

**For each component:**

#### Step 1: Skeleton (Sequential: prod → test)

**Create production skeleton FIRST:**
```
Task(skeleton-builder, """
Create skeleton for {component}.

Spec: $WORK_DIR/.spec/SPEC_{N}_{component}.md
Workflow: conduct

CRITICAL STANDARDS (from agent-prompting skill):
- Type hints required, 80 char limit
- Logging: import logging; LOG = logging.getLogger(__name__)

Read spec: $WORK_DIR/.spec/SPEC_{N}_{component}.md
""")
```

**Wait for completion, validate syntax:**
```bash
python -m py_compile {component_file}
# or: tsc --noEmit (TypeScript)
```

**THEN create test skeleton (needs prod skeleton to reference):**
```
Task(test-skeleton-builder, """
Create test skeleton for {component}.

Spec: $WORK_DIR/.spec/SPEC_{N}_{component}.md
Workflow: conduct

Production skeleton: {component_file}

CRITICAL STANDARDS (from agent-prompting skill):
- 1:1 file mapping: tests/unit/test_<module>.py
- AAA pattern structure

Read spec: $WORK_DIR/.spec/SPEC_{N}_{component}.md
""")
```

**Update PROGRESS.md with skeleton completion**

**Commit changes** (pre-commit validation runs automatically)

---

#### Step 2: Task-by-Task Implementation

**Read implementation phases and tasks from SPEC_{N}_{component}.md:**
```markdown
## Implementation Phases
### Phase 1: Foundation (2h estimate)
Tasks:
- Implement data models
- Implement validation logic

### Phase 2: API (1h estimate)
Tasks:
- Implement endpoint handlers
- Add error handling
```

**For EACH task in EACH phase:**

**Determine if tasks can run in parallel (BATCHING ALGORITHM):**

```
# Analyze task dependencies within phase
task_deps = extract_task_dependencies(phase_tasks)

# Group into waves (topological sort within phase)
waves = topological_sort(phase_tasks, task_deps)

For each wave in waves:
  independent_tasks = tasks_in_wave

  # Parallel execution criteria:
  IF len(independent_tasks) >= 3 AND estimated_duration_per_task > 30s:
    # Batch parallel execution
    Execute ALL tasks in wave simultaneously:
    - Spawn N implementation-executors in PARALLEL (single message)
    - Wait for all to complete
    - Run 2 reviewers per task in PARALLEL
  ELSE:
    # Sequential execution (coordination overhead not worth it)
    For each task:
      Execute task sequentially
```

**Example batching:**
```
Wave 1 (parallel - 3 independent tasks):
  - "Implement data models" (40s)
  - "Implement validation logic" (35s)
  - "Implement utility functions" (30s)
  → Spawn 3 implementation-executors in PARALLEL

Wave 2 (sequential - depends on Wave 1):
  - "Implement API endpoint (depends on models)" (50s)
  → Execute after Wave 1 completes

Wave 3 (parallel - 2 independent tasks):
  - "Add error handling" (25s)
  - "Add logging" (20s)
  → Duration too short, execute sequentially (overhead > benefit)
```

**For EACH task:**

```
1. Implement task:
   Task(implementation-executor, """
   Implement: {task description}

   Spec: $WORK_DIR/.spec/SPEC_{N}_{component}.md
   Workflow: conduct

2. Validate task (2 code-reviewers in PARALLEL - single message with 2 Task calls):

3. Fix issues (if found) - WITH INTELLIGENT FAILURE PATTERN DETECTION AND VOTING:

     failure_history = []

         ELSE:
           # Different issues = making progress
           ESCALATE: "Multiple different issues after 2 attempts. Need human review."

4. Update tracking:
   - PROGRESS.md: Mark task complete
   - DISCOVERIES.md: Note any gotchas/learnings from this task

5. Commit changes for this task (pre-commit validation runs)

**Common failure patterns to detect:**
- **Circular dependency**: Same circular import error → suggest dependency inversion or interface extraction
- **Tight coupling**: Same coupling violation → suggest facade pattern or dependency injection
- **Complexity**: Same complexity warning → suggest function extraction or class decomposition
- **Type errors**: Same type mismatch → suggest protocol/abstract base class

**After ALL tasks in component complete:**

Update DISCOVERIES.md with component summary:
```markdown
## Component: {component_name} (Phase {N})

### Implementation Notes
- {consolidated learnings from all tasks}
- {gotchas encountered}
- {deviations from spec}

### API Surface
- {public functions/classes}

#### GATE 4: Fix Strategy Voting (Full Validation Loop)

**Trigger:** IF same_issues_repeated(failure_history) after 3 fix attempts

**Process:** Same as GATE 4 in Task-by-Task loop, but applied to full component validation issues.

**Adjustments:**
- Context: "Full component validation" instead of specific task
- Issues: Consolidated issues from linting + 6 reviewers
- Scope: May involve multiple functions/classes across component

---

**Validation complete criteria:**
- ✅ Zero linting errors
- ✅ All critical issues fixed
- ✅ All important issues fixed
- ✅ All minor issues fixed (or documented why skipped)

**Commit changes** (pre-commit validation runs)

---

#### GATE 5: Component Production-Readiness Voting

**Trigger:** After Step 3 (Full Component Validation) passes - ALL fixes applied

**Goal:** Multi-agent consensus on whether component is truly production-ready.

**Process:**

1. **Spawn 3 code-reviewer agents in PARALLEL:**

   ```
   Task(code-reviewer, """
   Vote on production readiness for {component}.

   Component: {component_name}
   Spec: $WORK_DIR/.spec/SPEC_{N}_{component}.md
   Workflow: conduct

   Component has passed:
   - Task-by-task implementation with 2 reviewers per task
   - Full component validation (linting + 6 reviewers)
   - All critical/important/minor fixes applied

   Evaluate if component is TRULY production-ready:

   VOTE OPTIONS:
   - PRODUCTION_READY: Code is solid, well-tested logic, maintainable, follows standards
   - NEEDS_WORK: Passes validation but has concerns (code smells, maintainability issues)
   - RISKY: Technical debt, unclear logic, or fragile implementation despite passing checks

   Return JSON:

   # Spawn reviewers 2 and 3 with same prompt but different voter_id
   ```

2. **Collect votes and determine consensus:**

   ```
   votes = [vote1, vote2, vote3]

   # Count votes
   vote_counts = count_votes(votes, 'vote')

   IF any vote has >= 2 (2/3 consensus):
     winning_vote = vote_with_most_votes

     Document in DISCOVERIES.md:
     ```markdown
     ## Production Readiness Voting: {component_name}

     🚨 DECISION NEEDED: Production Readiness Voting - No Consensus

     Component: {component_name}

     All validation passed, but reviewers disagree on production readiness:

     Votes:
     - Reviewer 1: {vote} - {reasoning}
       Concerns: {concerns}
     - Reviewer 2: {vote} - {reasoning}
       Concerns: {concerns}
     - Reviewer 3: {vote} - {reasoning}
       Concerns: {concerns}

     No vote achieved 2/3 consensus.

     Please decide:
     A. PRODUCTION_READY: Deploy as-is
     B. NEEDS_WORK: Note concerns, deploy anyway
     C. RISKY: Fix blocking issues first

     Your choice: [wait for user input]
     ```

     Document user decision in DISCOVERIES.md
   ```

---

#### Step 4: Enhance Future Phase Specs

**Update future component specs with discoveries from this component:**

```
For each remaining phase spec (SPEC_{M}_{component}.md where M > N):
  IF that component depends on current component:
    Update "What's Available from Previous Phases" section:

    - Add current component's API surface
    - Add gotchas from DISCOVERIES.md that affect future component
    - Add usage examples if relevant

    Example:
    ```markdown
    ## What's Available from Previous Phases

    ### Phase {N}: {current_component}
    - function_name(params) -> return_type
      - Location: file.py:123
      - Purpose: What it does
      - Gotcha: Known edge case
      - Example: usage_example()
    ```
```

**Commit changes**

---

#### Step 5: Component Checkpoint

**Component fully complete:**
- ✅ Skeleton created (prod + test)
- ✅ All tasks implemented and validated
- ✅ Full component validation passed
- ✅ Production-readiness voting approved (GATE 5)
- ✅ Discoveries documented
- ✅ Future phase specs enhanced

**Summary:**
```
✅ Component {N}: {component_name} complete!

Files: X created, Y modified
Tasks: Z completed
Quality: All validation passed
Production Readiness: {PRODUCTION_READY|PRODUCTION_READY with recommendations}
Discoveries: [brief summary]

Ready for dependent components.
```

**Update TodoWrite: Mark component complete**

**Commit changes**

**NEXT component in dependency order...**

### Phase N+1: Documentation (Merge .spec to Permanent Docs)

**Goal:** Merge all learnings from .spec/ into permanent documentation before cleanup.

**Invoke documentation-reviewer to validate ALL current documentation:**

```

### Phase N+3: Cleanup .spec/

**Goal:** Clean up temporary .spec/ artifacts, archive task-related files, keep only permanent docs.

**Archive task-related files:**
```bash
# Create archive directory
mkdir -p $WORK_DIR/.spec/archive/

# Archive operational files
mv $WORK_DIR/.spec/PROGRESS.md $WORK_DIR/.spec/archive/
mv $WORK_DIR/.spec/DISCOVERIES.md $WORK_DIR/.spec/archive/

# Archive component phase specs (keep SPEC.md for reference)
mv $WORK_DIR/.spec/SPEC_*.md $WORK_DIR/.spec/archive/ 2>/dev/null || true

# Keep SPEC.md as permanent reference
# Keep DOC_VALIDATION_REPORT.json for reference
```

**Update .gitignore to exclude archived files:**
```bash
echo ".spec/archive/" >> $WORK_DIR/.gitignore
```

**Commit changes** (pre-commit validation runs)

---

### Phase N+4: Complete

**Update SPEC.md (in archive now):**
- Add any major gotchas discovered to "Known Gotchas" section
- Note any TODOs for future work

**Final summary:**
```
✅ Implementation complete!

Components: X implemented and validated
Testing: {Y unit tests passing, Z integration tests passing} OR {Skipped - not requested}
Documentation: All validated and updated
Quality: All validation passed

System ready for use.
```

## Worktree Variant Exploration

**Use when:**
- Multiple valid approaches for same component
- Architectural uncertainty
- High-risk changes

**Process:**
1. Decide on N approaches for component
2. Create worktrees: `git worktree add ../variant-a` etc.
3. For each variant:
   - Run component phase (Skeleton → Task Implementation → Validate) in that worktree
   - Track results in PROGRESS.md
4. Spawn investigator per variant (parallel)
5. Compare results:
   - Pick winner, OR
   - Spawn merge-coordinator to combine best parts
6. Cleanup worktrees: `git worktree remove ../variant-a`

---

## Sub-Agents

**Implementation:** skeleton-builder, implementation-executor, test-implementer, test-skeleton-builder
**Validation:** security-auditor, performance-optimizer, code-reviewer, code-beautifier, documentation-reviewer
**Fixing:** fix-executor
**Analysis:** general-investigator, general-builder

All inherit parent tools (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob).

All agents spawned during /conduct receive:
```
Spec: $WORK_DIR/.spec/SPEC_{N}_{component}.md
Workflow: conduct
```

## Tracking

**SPEC.md:** High-level architecture (created by /spec, archived after /conduct)
**SPEC_N_component.md:** Per-component phase specs (generated by /conduct, archived after)
**DISCOVERIES.md:** Learnings captured during implementation (archived after)
**PROGRESS.md:** Detailed task tracking (archived after)
**TodoWrite:** High-level component completion tracking
**Git commits:** After each major step (with pre-commit validation)

**Templates:** `~/.claude/templates/operational.md`

## Escalation

**When:**
- 3 failed fix attempts (with repeated failure pattern)
- Architectural decisions needed
- Critical security unfixable
- External deps missing
- Voting gate reaches no consensus and requires user decision

**Format:**
```
🚨 BLOCKED: [Component/Phase] - [Issue]

Issue: [description]
Attempts: [what tried]
Pattern Detected: [if applicable - repeated failure analysis]
Voting Results: [if applicable - gate voting breakdown]
Need: [specific question]
Options: [A, B, C with implications]
Recommendation: [your suggestion]
```

## Key Rules

**DO:**
- Require .spec/SPEC.md
- Run change impact analysis (Phase 3)
- Run GATE 3 (Impact Analysis Voting) if transitive_dependents > 10
- Verify dependencies match reality (Phase 4)
- Batch independent tasks for parallel execution
- Detect intelligent failure patterns in fix loops
- Run GATE 4 (Fix Strategy Voting) when same issue repeats
- Generate SPEC_N_component.md files if not exist
- Execute per-component: Skeleton (sequential) → Task-by-Task Impl (2 reviewers per task) → Full Validation (6 reviewers)
- Run GATE 5 (Component Production-Readiness Voting) after full validation passes
- Update PROGRESS.md + DISCOVERIES.md throughout
- Parallelize: reviewers, independent tasks, independent component tests, voting gates
- Enhance future phase specs with discoveries
- Documentation phase BEFORE testing
- Run GATE 7 (Documentation Quality Voting) after doc fixes
- Testing ONLY if user requested
- Run GATE 6 (Test Coverage Adequacy Voting) after tests pass with 95%+ coverage
- Archive .spec/ files after completion
- Commit after major steps (with pre-commit validation)

**DON'T:**
- Proceed without SPEC.md
- Skip dependency verification (Phase 4)
- Skip per-task validation (2 reviewers required)
- Skip voting gates when triggered
- Move to next component with failing validation
- Run tests unless user requested
- Let sub-agents spawn sub-agents
- Skip documentation validation before cleanup
- Delete .spec/ files before merging learnings to permanent docs
- Retry blindly without analyzing failure patterns

**You are the conductor. Analyze impact with voting when high-risk, verify dependencies, batch parallel work, detect patterns, execute incrementally with validation at each step, use voting gates for critical decisions, deliver working system.**
