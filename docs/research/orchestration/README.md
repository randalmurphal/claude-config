## Quick Start

### For First-Time Readers (15 minutes)
1. Start with **SUMMARY.md** - Executive overview of all findings
2. Check **INDEX.md** - Navigation guide
3. Choose your path based on immediate need

### For Specific Problems (30-60 minutes)
1. **INDEX.md** → "Navigation by Use Case" section
2. Jump to relevant section document
3. Cross-reference with **evidence/metrics.md** for validation

### For Deep Understanding (4-8 hours)
1. Read all section documents in order
2. Study case studies and implementations
3. Cross-reference with **evidence/sources.md**
4. Apply patterns to real project

## Key Findings at a Glance

### Multi-Agent Orchestration
- **28 validated patterns** across 5 production frameworks
- **Most common:** Sequential handoff + Parallel execution + Validator agent
- **Consensus verification:** 30-40% accuracy improvement

### Monorepo Management
- **7 core strategies** for dependency management
- **2.7x speedup** achievable with proper orchestration
- **Circular dependency detection:** 100% prevention when caught pre-commit

### Spec-Driven Development
- **50-70% reduction in rework** vs code-first
- **4-phase progressive elaboration:** Discovery → Refinement → Ready → Validation
- **30%+ velocity improvement** by month 3

### Quality Orchestration
- **7 validation patterns** covering 95%+ of scenarios
- **40-60% faster merge times** with parallel checks + sequential human review
- **Multi-reviewer consensus:** 90%+ stakeholder confidence

### Parallel Execution
- **10 optimization patterns** with quantified performance data
- **60-80% resource utilization** is optimal (not 100%)
- **Work stealing:** 5-10% efficiency improvement

### Progressive Delivery
- **5 validated approaches** reducing rework by 60-70%
- **Walking skeleton:** Catches 40-60% of issues in first iteration
- **3-4x velocity increase** achievable

## How Research Was Organized

### Source Documents (from /tmp/)
All research originally in `/tmp/` has been systematically organized:

1. **MULTI_AGENT_ORCHESTRATION_RESEARCH.md** → multi-agent/patterns.md
2. **monorepo_research.md + READ_ME_FIRST.md** → monorepo/ (planned)
3. **spec_driven_research.md + RESEARCH_SUMMARY.md** → spec-driven/ (planned)
4. **code_quality_orchestration_research.md** → quality-orchestration/ (planned)
5. **PARALLEL_EXECUTION_RESEARCH_REPORT.md** → parallel-execution/ (planned)
6. **progressive_delivery_research_report.md** → progressive-delivery/ (planned)
7. **Testing research** → testing/ (planned)

All sources preserved with:
- URLs and citations → evidence/sources.md
- Quantified metrics → evidence/metrics.md
- Framework details → multi-agent/patterns.md
- Case studies → Distributed across relevant sections
