# Legacy Code Modernization Consulting - Business Proposal

## The Core Idea
Help mid-size tech companies modernize legacy codebases using AI-assisted development. Fix systems that are too expensive/risky to touch and make them maintainable again. Fast.

## Why This Works
- Universal pain point (every company has "untouchable" legacy code)
- Quantifiable ROI (weeks instead of years for refactors)
- We have proof of concept (Tenable SC refactor - pending results)
- Market timing is perfect (companies paralyzed between AI hype and fear)
- Clear before/after value proposition

## Team Composition
- **Technical lead** who understands AI tooling (Randy)
- **CTO** with system/architecture expertise (Friend 1)
- **Business person** for sales/operations (Friend 2)

## Initial Service Focus (The Wedge)
Start with ONE specific offering:

> "We modernize legacy Python codebases for tech companies using AI-assisted development"

## Service Delivery Model

### 1. Discovery (1 week, fixed price)
Map legacy system, identify pain points, create modernization plan

### 2. Refactor Sprint (2-4 weeks, fixed price)
Execute refactor with AI tooling, full test coverage, documentation

### 3. Knowledge Transfer (1 week, fixed price)
Train their team on new codebase + AI tooling

### 4. Retainer Option
Ongoing advisory/support

## Path to Customer #1
1. Document the Tenable refactor as case study (concrete numbers, before/after)
2. Share with network (LinkedIn, company connections, CTO's network)
3. Offer free discovery calls ("let me analyze one of your systems")
4. Convert 1 of 5 discovery calls to paid pilot
5. Deliver amazing results
6. Get referrals

## Upsell Opportunities (Later)
- Team training on AI-assisted development
- Tech stack modernization consulting
- Fractional CTO advisory
- Hiring/org structure guidance

## Timeline to Validate
- **Weeks 1-2:** Complete Tenable refactor, document results
- **Weeks 3-4:** Share case study, schedule discovery calls
- **Weeks 5-8:** Land and deliver first paid pilot
- **Week 9:** Decide if we scale or pivot

## What Kills This
- Trying to be everything to everyone (stay focused on the wedge)
- No clear deliverables (scope creep hell)
- Relying on AI to sell (sales is still human work)
- Running out of money before finding product-market fit

## What Makes This Work
- Focused on ONE painful problem
- Proof we can deliver (pending validation)
- Clear value prop with measurable ROI
- Repeatable playbook approach
- Huge addressable market

## First Steps
1. Finish and document Tenable refactor
2. Create simple case study/pitch deck
3. Schedule 5 discovery calls with warm network
4. Price out first engagement (suggest starting at $15-25k for pilot)
5. Deliver one amazing result
6. Decide next move

## Key Question to Answer
**Are we willing to be uncomfortable for 3-6 months while validating demand?**
