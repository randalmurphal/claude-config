# Memory MCP Test Results

## Installation Status
✅ Memory MCP (enhanced-memory-mcp v1.4.8) successfully installed
✅ Added to Claude configuration via: `claude mcp add enhanced-memory npx enhanced-memory-mcp`
✅ Server shows as "Connected" in MCP list

## Configuration
- Command: `npx enhanced-memory-mcp`
- Status: Connected
- Location: Added to /home/randy/.claude.json

## Next Steps
To use Memory MCP tools, you'll need to:
1. Start a new Claude session (the MCP tools will be available in the next session)
2. Look for new memory-related tools like:
   - memory_create
   - memory_search
   - memory_list
   - memory_delete
   - memory_update
   - And ~16 other memory management tools

## What Memory MCP Provides
Based on the documentation, you'll have access to:
- **Core Memory Operations**: Create, read, update, delete memories
- **Advanced Search**: Semantic search, entity tracking, relationship mapping
- **Auto-tagging**: AI-powered content analysis and tagging
- **Graph Relationships**: Connect memories in a knowledge graph
- **Backup/Restore**: Save and restore memory databases

## Testing the Adaptive Orchestration Concept
Once Memory MCP tools are available, we can test:
1. Storing orchestration patterns as memories
2. Retrieving patterns based on context
3. Building the pattern selection logic
4. Testing dynamic phase injection

The Memory MCP is now ready to use in future sessions!
